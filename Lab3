1. Log in to VM as the student user.
2. Generate SSH keys for the student user. Do not protect the private key with a passphrase. Save the private and public keys as the /home/student/.ssh/review3_key and /home/student/.ssh/review3_key.pub files respectively.
3. Configure the student user on servera to accept logins that are authenticated by the review3_key SSH key pair. The student user on serverb should be able to log in to servera by using SSH without entering a password.
4. On VM, configure the sshd service to prevent the root user from logging in.
5. On VM, configure the sshd service to prevent users from using their passwords to log in. Users should still be able to authenticate logins by using an SSH key pair.
6. Install the zsh package on the serverb machine.
